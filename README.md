# Cursor AI Experiments

This repository contains a collection of Python programs created to experiment with Cursor AI capabilities.

## Contents

1. **Hello World Program**
   - `hello_robo.py`: A simple function that prints a message
   - `main.py`: Demonstrates how to import and use the function from another file

2. **Directory Scanner**
   - `directory_scanner.py`: A utility that:
     - Prompts for a directory path
     - Lists all files and folders in the specified directory
     - Shows file sizes in human-readable format (B, KB, MB, GB)
     - Handles various error cases (non-existent paths, permission issues, etc.)

## Usage

1. For the Hello World program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. For the Directory Scanner:
   ```bash
   python directory_scanner.py
   ```
   Then enter the path to the directory you want to scan when prompted.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional packages required
